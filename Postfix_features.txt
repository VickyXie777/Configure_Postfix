Postfix process runs with the least amount of privilege necessary to get its particular job done.
Attacks that use signals, shared memory, open files, and other types of interprocess communication are essentially useless against Postfix.
Postfix avoids using fixed-size buffers for dynamic data, making a successful buffer overflow attack highly unlikely.
Postfix processes are configured to use a limited amount of memory, so they do not grow uncontrollably from an onslaught of messages.
